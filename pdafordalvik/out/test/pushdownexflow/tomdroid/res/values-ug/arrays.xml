        <item>"Welcome to Tomdroid!
"</item>
        <item>"You have no notes here yet. To get started, set your Synchronization preferences under Settings. There are two synchronization options described below.
"</item>
        <item>=Online Synchronization=</item>
        <item>"Online Synchronization is what you are looking for if you want to sync to Tomboy-Online, Ubuntu One, your own Snowy server or any server supporting the Tomboy Web REST API.
"</item>
        <item>To use it, set Sync Service to Online Synchronization in preferences then provide a Server URL. Here are some of the public ones:</item>
        <item>-Tomboy Online - https://edge.tomboy-online.org/</item>
        <item>"-Ubuntu One - https://one.ubuntu.com/notes
"</item>
        <item>"Once set, hit the Sync logo on Tomdroid's top bar to synchronize your notes.
"</item>
        <item>"Note: you might want to back up your Tomboy notes before syncing, since this app is still under development and may corrupt your Tomboy notes. The notes can be found in ~/.local/share/tomboy/ on Linux.
"</item>
        <item>=SD Card=</item>
        <item>"Put your Tomboy notes (*.note) on your SD Card under tomdroid/. The notes can be found in ~/.local/share/tomboy/ on Linux. Once the notes are copied, set Sync Service to SD Card in preferences then hit the Sync logo on Tomdroid's top bar.
"</item>
        <item>"See http://live.gnome.org/Tomboy/Directories for the notes' location on other platforms.
"</item>
        <item>"Also, Tomdroid is always looking for new contributors. If you are interested join the tomdroid-dev team on launchpad: http://launchpad.net/~tomdroid-dev.
