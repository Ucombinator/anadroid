<p>FAQ</p>
<p ><span class="question">How much space will the app take up on my phone?</span><br/>
About a quarter of a megabyte. That's less than a photo. 
</p>
<p ><span class="question">Where is the app on my phone?</span><br/>
Once you've installed it, the app will be in the same place as all your other apps and games. Normally there's a menu or folder called 'Applications' or 'Downloads'. If you're not sure what that folder is, check your phone's user guide.
</p>
<p ><span class="question">How do I pay for my ticket?</span><br/>
Once you've clicked 'Buy', type in your credit or debit card details. Or, if you've linked your O2 Wallet to O2 Train Travel, you'll be asked to put in three numbers from your Pay Password, and your card's security number (the 3 digit number next to the signature strip). 
</p>
<p ><span class="question">Will I need to create an account to buy a ticket?</span><br/>
No. We've made O2 Train Travel so you can buy tickets quickly and easily &#45; without having to set up an account or sign in.
</p>
<p ><span class="question">Will I need to put my card details in every time I buy a ticket?</span><br/>
Yes. That way, we keep your bank details safe &#45; because we'll never store them in the app or on your phone. If you've linked your O2 Wallet to Train Travel, you'll only need to put in three numbers from your Pay Password, and your card's security number 
(the 3 digit number next to the signature strip).
</p>
<p ><span class="question">Is the app secure?</span><br/>
Yes. We've used the latest software to keep you safe. And we'll never store your card details on the app or on your phone. So you don't need to worry about them falling into the wrong hands.
</p>
<p ><span class="question">Will my card details be stored on the app or my phone?</span><br/>
No. But the app will recognise the card type, like Visa, and the last four digits of the card number.
</p>
<p ><span class="question">How do I link my Train Travel app to my O2 Wallet?</span><br/>
If you have an O2 Wallet you can 'auto&#45;link' both apps by opening your O2 Wallet and tapping on the O2 Train Travel app icon that you'll see on the home screen. It could be on the second page of your home screen so swipe or scroll if you don't first see it.  
</p>
<p ><span class="question">Can I link my O2 Wallet from within O2 Train Travel?</span><br/>
Yes. From the home screen of O2 Train Travel click on the 'Link to my O2 Wallet now' button.  The next screen will confirm you want to link both apps, click 'Manual link' button.  You will need your MyO2 username, password and O2 Money Account Password.
