	<p>O2 Train Travel is an app for searching train times and buying tickets.</p>
	<p>Once you&rsquo;ve linked your O2 Wallet to O2 Train Travel and have found your ticket, all you have to do is type in your Pay Password, and the security number (CVV) for the card you want to use.  Or you can always manually type in your debit or credit card details</p>
	<p>Once you&rsquo;ve bought a ticket, we&rsquo;ll either send you:
	<div >
		<img src="fulfil_barcode.png" class="fulfilicon" style="float:left" />
		<div style="margin-left: 40px;">An mTicket delivered as a barcode to your phone; or</div>
	</div>
	<div style="clear: left; margin-top: 8px">
		<img src="fulfil_tod.png" class="fulfilicon" style="float:left" />
		<div style="margin-left: 40px;">  A collection reference code. You&rsquo;ll just need to pick up your paper tickets from a self-service ticket machine from a station.</div>
	</div>
	<p>We&rsquo;ll always send you an mTicket (if it&rsquo;s available for your train journey).</p>
	<p>Once we&rsquo;ve sent you the mTicket or paper ticket collection code, it will stay on your phone for 30 days after the expiry date of your ticket.</p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re connected via wifi it&rsquo;s free to search for train times and buy tickets.</p>
	<p>If you&rsquo;re using 3G your provider might charge you.  As a general rule, the amount of internet you&rsquo;ll need to buy each ticket will cost you less than 1p. But make sure you understand how your provider charges for using 3G before you use the app. </p>
    <p>You don&rsquo;t need to be connected to a mobile network or wifi to look at any tickets you&rsquo;ve bought. </p>
    <p>If you are having any trouble give us a call on <a href="tel:10202">10202</a> (free for O2 customers) or <a href="tel:08447010202">0844 70 10202</a> (charges apply) and we'll help.<br />
