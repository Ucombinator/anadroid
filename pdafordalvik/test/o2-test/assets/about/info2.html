<p>Train journeys that have a paper ticket symbol must be collected from a station ticket machine before you leave.</p>
<p style="clear:left">If we can&rsquo;t send you a mTicket, we&rsquo;ll send you a collection reference code. You can find this under &rsquo;My Tickets&rsquo; in the main menu.  You&rsquo;ll need to type this in to a self-service ticket machine at the station to get your tickets. You&rsquo;ll also need to have a bank card in your name with you, to put into the machine. But you won&rsquo;t be charged again.  It doesn&rsquo;t have to be the card that you used to purchase the ticket, but it has to be in your name.
</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget, the collection reference itself isn&rsquo;t a ticket.
</p>
<p>The collection code will stay on your phone for 30 days after the expiry date of your ticket.
