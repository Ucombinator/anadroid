<p>mTickets are available for some journeys; these will show a barcode symbol and will be sent to your phone.</p>
<p style="clear:left">Once we&rsquo;ve sent you the mTicket, you&rsquo;ll find it under &rsquo;My tickets&rsquo; in the main menu. It&rsquo;ll stay on there for 30 days after the expiry date of your ticket.
</p>
<p>At the station, you&rsquo;ll either need to scan it at the gate, or show it to someone from the train operator to scan.
</p>
<p>A mTicket is just like a paper ticket. So when you use it to travel, you might be asked to show it at any time.
</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to be connected to a mobile network or wifi to look at any tickets you&rsquo;ve bought. 
</p>
<p>We are unable to provide a receipt for your journey where an mTicket is purchased via the O2 Train Travel Mobile app.
